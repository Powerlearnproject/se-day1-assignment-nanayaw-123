#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is a system that applies engineering principlies, methods and tools to develop and maintain high-guality software system.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements:Its about gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design:It's about creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation:It's about writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodologies                  |        Agile methodologies
- They are sequential approach with      | It is a iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility,
 distinct  phases flowing downwards like |  collabration, and responding to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

-Technical debt.                              |-Prioritization of tasks.
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompting engineering is about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible 
response from AI models. Importance of prompt engineering is to help aviod asking a vague 
quetions and getting a confusing answer by making your questions clear and specific so that the AI 
can understand exactly what you need.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
 “Can you provide details on Thomas Edison’s invention of the light bulb?”.
 This  prompt specifies not only the person (Edison) but also narrows down the topic to Edison’s involvement with the light bulb.
